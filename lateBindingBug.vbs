Late Binding: VBScript's late binding can lead to runtime errors if an object or method doesn't exist.  This is especially problematic when dealing with COM objects or external libraries where version mismatches or missing components can occur.  The error often manifests as a "Type mismatch" or "Object doesn't support this property or method" error, making debugging difficult because the error doesn't show up until runtime.
