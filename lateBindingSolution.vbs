Early Binding: To avoid late-binding issues, use early binding by declaring object variables with their specific type. This allows the VBScript interpreter to check for the existence of methods and properties at compile time, resulting in clearer and earlier error reporting.  This improved error detection reduces runtime surprises. 

Example:

'Instead of:
Dim objFSO
Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
If objFSO.NonExistentMethod Then  'This will fail at runtime
  MsgBox "Method exists!"
end if

'Use early binding:
Dim objFSO As Object
Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
On Error Resume Next 'Error handling is crucial in case of issues
If objFSO.FileExists("myFile.txt") Then  'More robust than previous example
   MsgBox "File exists!"
Else
   MsgBox "File does not exist"
End If
